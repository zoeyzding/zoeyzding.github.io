      <description>(alternative title: I decide to focus on English contents)
The day job I have been doing recently is editing and writing user manuals, which should always be international-oriented.

      <description>One of my pastimes is watching documentaries about culture and humanities. Among various channels, NHK’s documentaries never let me down. And the good thing is, some programs can be streamed within a certain period on NHK World.
Recently, I have been obsessed with a program called “Hometown Stories” — stories about local people around Japan. I haven’t watched much though, some stories have left me with a touching impression.
One episode of the show is called “A ‘Truckful’ of food and smile.</description>
