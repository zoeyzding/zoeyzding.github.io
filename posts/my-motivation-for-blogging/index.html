Although I still want to share and make content reasonably accessible for everyone, I feel my desire of “writing (in English)” weighs higher than “sharing ideas.” Secondly, I want to make my life easier: since these thoughts naturally come out of my mind in English rather than Chinese, writing the drafts in English becomes an intuition.\n(The inner struggle ends, and finally, I farewell to the idea of writing in both English and Chinese.)\nBut once decided, my anxiety transferred to “how can I overcome my perfectionism of using English,” which is also overlapped with “how can I overcome my perfectionism of generally doing anything .” I do have some experience of English writing back to college, but I have never been self-motivated to write English publicly. Unfortunately, I am also a perfectionist, which doubtlessly leads to procrastination.\nI have no way to do with overcoming my perfectionism. All I can do is self-hypnosis. I try to tell myself: Don’t worry too much about the grammar or words or phrases, because even the native speakers cannot guarantee perfectness, not to mention me as a native Chinese. JUST FOCUS ON THE CONTENTS. When I think this way, I feel the pressure of “writing each post perfectly” vanishes. Instead, I feel a sense of freedom. — I know this blog is just a tiny piece of leaf in the forest. But I still assume that my thoughts will be read by someone in the corner of the world. If it happens, it’s undoubtedly my pleasure. If no one’s reading, I still feel okay.\nThough I wrote the things above, I still want to write a few lines for YOU: If you have any thoughts and ideas you would like to share, please send me an email by clicking the mail icon on my home page. I will be surprised but also be very glad.\n","wordCount":"453","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-02-05T20:57:00+08:00","dateModified":"2022-02-05T20:57:00+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"zoeyzding"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://zoeyzding.github.io/posts/my-motivation-for-blogging/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zoeyzding","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://zoeyzding.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>.theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://zoeyzding.github.io accesskey=h>zoeyzding</a>
