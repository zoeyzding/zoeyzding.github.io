Recently, I have been obsessed with a program called “Hometown Stories” — stories about local people around Japan. I haven’t watched much though, some stories have left me with a touching impression.

I haven’t watched much though, some stories have left me with a touching impression.\nOne episode of the show is called “A ‘Truckful’ of food and smile.” It tells a story of a young woman as a grocery truck driver. Every morning, she drives around the town, sets up temporary grocery trucks to provide convenience for those who cannot (or don’t want to) go far to reach groceries.\nWe all know that one of the severest consequences of Japan’s urbanization is the ever-increasing number of super-aging suburbs.
